This project will periodically generate a trivia podcast and upload it to podcast services.

The podcasts will have 4 'rounds' with a unique category where each round has 5 quesions. The associated answers will be read after all questions are finished.

There (might) be intro/outro music, random facts read between questions and answers, and other stuff.
